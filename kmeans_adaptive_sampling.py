    """Adaptive low-rank seeding by sampling with residual-based weights.

    At each iteration, this function selects a new center by sampling one point
    with probability proportional to the squared row norm of the current
    residual matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data matrix.

    n_clusters : int
        Number of centers to choose.

    random_state : RandomState instance
        Random number generator used to select points.

    Returns
    -------
    centers : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        The selected centers from X.

    indices : ndarray of shape (n_clusters,)
        The indices of the chosen centers in X.

    residuals : list of float
        Frobenius norm of the residual after each center selection.

    times : list of float
        Elapsed time at each selection step.
